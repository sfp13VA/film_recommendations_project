# Business Understanding
The company would like to create a new movie studio for original video content, but we don't have any experience with making movies. Here, we want to explore what types of films are performing best at the box office currently in order to make recommendations about what type of films to create in our new studio.

# Data Understanding
We are working with two datasets provided by IMDB and The Numbers.  The data includes information about movies and their genres, ratings, staff, domestic and international gross revenue, budget, and more.
